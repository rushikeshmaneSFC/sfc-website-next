            the global leader in AI-based identity security and governance
            solutions, today announced a strategic partnership with St. Fox
            (read as Saint Fox), a next-gen cybersecurity solutions provider, to
            drive its go-to-market (GTM) strategy and execution in India. This
            alliance marks a significant step in Saviynt&apos;s commitment to India
            as a priority growth market and reinforces its partner-first
            approach to co-create outcomes and value for customers.
          </p>

          <p>
            As India undergoes rapid digital transformation, the demand for
            intelligent identity solutions has surged across sectors. From
            securing hybrid IT environments to meeting evolving compliance
            mandates, Indian enterprises need agile and unified identity
            platforms. Together, Saviynt and St. Fox will deliver an integrated
            suite of solutions, including Identity Governance and Administration
            (IGA), Privileged Access Management (PAM), Just-in-Time Access
            (JITA), and Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) with local
            execution strength and cybersecurity delivery capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;St. Fox is not just a new partner, we see them as a force
            multiplier,&quot; said Nitin Varma, managing director, India and SAARC at
            Saviynt. &quot;As we shape our India GTM strategy, building the right
            ecosystem becomes imperative. We are investing in a scalable,
            trusted partner ecosystem built on the foundational pillars of
            enablement, loyalty, and profitability—aligned solely to create
            meaningful outcomes for our customers. Together, as we co-create, we
            will help enterprises reimagine privilege, access, and trust, not
            around static perimeters, but around dynamic identities, henceforth
            transforming identity from a potential vulnerability into a
            competitive strength.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            St. Fox will play a critical role in expanding Saviynt&apos;s regional
            reach, capability, and capacity. The strategic alignment between
            Saviynt and St. Fox is rooted in both technological depth and
            industry relevance and will enable:

          </ul>

          <p>
            &quot;At St. Fox, we recognise the fact that identity has become the new
            perimeter. Cyber threats continue to evolve, and identity compromise
            remains a common pattern in all major breaches. Further, a strategy
            to rely only on MFA or SSO i.e., &apos;Access Management&apos; is not helping
            anymore while the burden of compliance and reporting is increasing
            manifold,&quot; said Sunil Tak, co-founder and chief executive officer at
            St. Fox. &quot;To address these challenges for our customers, we are
            proud to partner with industry leader Saviynt, a true cloud-native,
            identity-centric platform that converges IGA, PAM, JITA and ISPM
            requirements into a single, unified platform.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            This collaboration deepens Saviynt&apos;s local investment strategy. With
            a dedicated GTM team, execution model, and growing partner
            enablement initiatives, Saviynt is scaling fast in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            This partnership is a natural extension of Saviynt&apos;s local
            investment strategy. In addition to a 600+ strong R&D and support
            center in India, Saviynt has recently appointed Sandeep Anand to
            lead partner strategy in the region. With a dedicated GTM team,
            pod-based execution model, and rapidly growing partner enablement
            initiatives, the company is deepening its local presence and
            delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;We are scaling fast in India, with local talent, local support, and
            now, the right local partnerships,&quot; said Sunil Kedaraji, vice
            president of partner sales for APJ (Asia-Pacific and Japan) at
            Saviynt. &quot;Our ecosystem engagement is maturing, and our
            collaboration with St. Fox is a key part of that. We are focused on
            accelerating time-to-value for customers and co-creating innovative,
            secure identity solutions that are tailored to the Indian market.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            With this partnership, Saviynt and St. Fox are doubling down on
            their commitment to the Indian market, creating the coverage,
            capacity, and capability needed to help enterprises embrace Zero
            Trust, streamline identity operations, and future-proof their
            security posture.
