          The Paris Olympic games have had a fair share of controversies, from
          the opening ceremony to the Boxing gender test fiasco, deplorable
          conditions the players have been reporting, Parisians threatening to
          relieve themselves in the Siene river, but what could perhaps be fatal
          is a cyberattack, especially when the world is seeing an unprecedented
          events of outages.

        <p className="md:leading-8 leading-6">
          The Paris 2024 Olympics represent a unique and complex cybersecurity
          challenge. The evolving threat landscape, historical cyber-attacks on
          the Olympics, and the increased sophistication of cybercriminals all
          underscore the need for a comprehensive and proactive approach to
          cybersecurity.

          The security and integrity of the Games, the preparedness strategy
