          IThe landscape of AI is shifting. While traditional AI focused on
          analyzing and learning from data, a new force has emerged: Generative
          AI (GenAI). This revolutionary technology harnesses the power of
          neural networks to create entirely new content, from text and code to
          images and sound. And its potential for enterprises is nothing short
          of transformative.
